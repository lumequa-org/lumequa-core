# Luméqua Core

**Luméqua** is a mission-driven, privacy-first AI initiative built to protect identity, promote equality, and transform the world.

This repository (`lumequa-core`) serves as the foundation — setting the structure, direction, and values behind the technology.

## Core Values

- **Privacy**: We believe in safeguarding the identity and data of every individual.
- **Equality**: We aim to create tools that uplift and empower all people, regardless of background.
- **Impact**: We design for real-world change and long-term sustainability.
- **Collaboration**: We build in community, not isolation.

## Getting Started

This repo will hold the core logic, ideas, architecture, and vision. It's evolving — just like the people behind it.

## Stay tuned

More files, structure, and collaboration coming soon. The story is just beginning.
